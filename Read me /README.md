# Password Generator - Bootcamp Assignment

## Overview

Hello! 👋 I'm Sandesh Gurung, a bootcamp student, and I've crafted this Password Generator as part of an assignment. It's a fantastic tool that allows employees to create strong, random passwords based on specific criteria. The application is designed to run in the browser and features a clean interface with responsive design.

## Assignment Requirements

- **Generate Password**: Click the "Generate Password" button.
- **Password Criteria**: Answer prompts for password criteria, including length and character types.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure the password length is between 8 and 128 characters, and at least one character type is selected.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
2. Click "Generate Password."
3. Answer the prompts to set your criteria.
4. Your new password will be displayed on the page or in an alert.

## Code Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.c
- `style.css`: CSS styling for the application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for password generation.
